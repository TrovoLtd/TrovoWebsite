# TrovoWebsite

For some crazy reason I decided to build my own blog-type website entirely in public.

I originally forked Orchard but I _really_ don't need a full-on CMS for my site. 

So instead I'm going to knock my own one together and write all the content in Markdown.

## Current Status

Setting up the "out of the box" ASP.Net 4.6.1 MVC website.

Adding a reference to [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig).

Part of the fun of making a website using Markdown is that I can [tell the story of it as I go along](src/TrovoWebsite/TrovoWebsite/Content/Home.md).
