# Potential Solid Domains



Off the top of my head, I can think of two Domains with potential problems that Solid might help address...



## Academic research and knowledge management: 

I think there are probably some killer apps that Solid could be part of in this Domain, which would be fitting as it's the one that Sir Tim founded the WWW from in the first place, of course. Just off the top of my head I can think of two thorny academic problems that Solid could help with... 

Firstly, it's just tricky to keep track of who was doing what research, where, and with whom. Academics need to be able to carry their achievements around with them, while institutions also need to be able to account for which work was done under their auspices, and all of that gets even harder when research teams span institutions, and lines of inquiry can take years to pursue. I found out enough about this while sitting on the University of Cambridge's Research Data Management Working Group to make ones hair curl. One of the earlier Research Excellence Framework assessments in the UK fell foul of this issue, with Professors with good academic results swapping institutions at the last minute in a fashion reminiscient of football's Transfer Deadline Day.  

Then the second problem relates to what happens to important knowledge when prominent Academics die: the archival profession still has a lot of thinking in terms of deceased academics leaving behind offices full of "boxes of files of papers" to be ingested and sifted through under such sad circumstances, but those days have by-and-large gone. Instead there's a non-existent heap of digital "files" to cope with, and because they're not really files, the whole "boxes of papers" approach clashes with the paperdigm metaphor and can result in a bit of a mess.

Fortunately the core of Solid is to formally provide individual owners with a global identity that can live as long as they do, and then it appears to be perfectly OK for:

1. Owners to own multiple pods.
2. Ownership to be passed onto others.

(Shared ownership of Pods might even be a thing, which might potentially help. I need to find out more...)

Just these two things would contribute greatly to helping solve both the issues above. An individual academic could build up a trail of Pods as they moved from one place to another, and access could be maintained at both an individual and institutional level. Though good models of how research is conducted to provide the Domain structure would be a big help... (Perhaps more on that in future?)

## Software / IT recruitment:

Anyone who has been in the Software Development game for any amount of time will tell you just how irritating the recruitment process is. Indeed it quite often strays way beyond irritating and into the realms of moral reprehensibility. It's bad enough when you're looking for a job, but if, like me, you've been involved in hiring people, it gets even worse. We're talking about a 360 degree shower of untruths, perpetrated by a gang of miscreants and cutthroats that make The Pirates of the Caribbean look like the Teddy Bears' Picnic. 

I may be exaggerating slightly for comic effect here (and it's a while since I've dared dive into the process), but fundamentally, technology such as email and the internet has distorted the process of recruiting technical staff to the point that the best way to succeed seems to be to just fling as much "stuff" at the wall as quickly as possible, so at least some of it sticks. This is made possible because the "content" used (candidate CVs on one side, company roles on the other) has to be "broadcast" in some way -  to be "put out there". 

This means that there's always plenty of "stuff" to throw, and plenty of walls to throw it at, and hence all you really need to be able to do to succeed is collect and throw quickly. Understanding the problems that companies have, and lining up appropriate candidates, are neither here nor there. Learning about the roles they're recruiting for, or the skills candidates have, doesn't give anyone a competitive advantage over the "stuff throwers"...

... at least, actually being good at recruitment doesn't give anyone a competitive advantage *while all the CVs and job descriptions remain in the public domain*. But imagine a world in which:

1. Candidates kept their CVs in Pods, to which they only granted access to recruiters they trusted would do a good job.
2. Companies kept their role descriptions in Pods, to which they only granted access to recruiters they trusted would do a good job. 

In *that* world, there's a massive competitive advantage to being a good recruiter, and the days of "stuff flinging" might potentially be numbered?
