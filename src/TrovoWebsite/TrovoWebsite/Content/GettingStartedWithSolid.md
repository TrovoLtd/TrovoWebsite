# Getting Started With Solid

My PhD had quite a lot to do with Social Media. I started it in 2012 while people were still feeling quite optimistic about that, but there's been a whole heap of Brexit, Donald Trump and so forth since then. Indeed it was quite obvious where it was all going while I was still working on it, so my thesis contains a healthy amount of references to people like [Zeynep Tufekci](https://zeynep.me/), [danah boyd](https://www.danah.org/), [Geert Lovink](https://networkcultures.org/geert/biography/) and a few other health naysayers. I stopped using Facebook shortly after I published my thesis, and while I still have a Twitter account and take the odd stroll around it now and again, I don't really use it.

However, it wasn't all doom and gloom: one of my conclusions was that it's not Social Media per-se that's at fault for the way things have gone, it's *the business models of the big, industrial Social Media companies* that's the problem. And part of the issue there is that those companies don't really have 'business models' in the traditional, old-fuddy-duddy sense of 'doing something valuable that people want to pay for'. Nope, they run on a 'get plenty of eyeballs using your platform and you can convince investors you'll be able to monetise that one day' model... And their focus is primarily on the former part of that - they want people to use their platforms and stick there, as this [marvellous Guardian long-read by Richard Seymour](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/23/social-media-addiction-gambling) explains. The upshot of all this is: nothing sticks like an argument. If we all agree, that's one post each, but if we all want to have the last word, well... 

Every post of Donald Trump's initiated a million "no you're the asshole, no you're the asshole" back-and-forths, which Twitter could add to their 'stickiness' stats and put in front of investors. This is why he went all the way up to the point of encouraging people to attack the Capitol Building, and beyond, before they switched him off. It's not what you'd call healthy, really, is it?
