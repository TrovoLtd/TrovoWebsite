# Getting Started With Solid

My PhD had quite a lot to do with Social Media. I started it in 2012 while people were still feeling quite optimistic about that, but there's been a whole heap of Brexit, Donald Trump and so forth since then. Indeed (OK, hindsight and all that) it was quite obvious there was going to be a bumpy road ahead while I was researching Social Media, so my thesis contains references to works by people like [Zeynep Tufekci](https://zeynep.me/), [danah boyd](https://www.danah.org/), [Geert Lovink](https://networkcultures.org/geert/biography/) and a few other healthy naysayers. I stopped using Facebook shortly after I published [my thesis](https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Does_the_way_museum_staff_define_inspiration_help_them_work_with_information_from_visitors_Social_Media_/9496598), and while I still have a Twitter account and take the odd stroll around it now and again, I don't really use it.

However, it wasn't all doom and gloom: one of my conclusions was that it's not Social Media per-se that's at fault for the way things have gone, it's *the business models of the big, industrial Social Media companies* that are the problem. Of course, those companies don't really have 'business models' in the traditional, fuddy-duddy sense of 'doing something valuable that people want to pay for'; they run on a 'get plenty of eyeballs using your platform and try to convince investors you'll be able to monetise that one day' model... As such, their focus is mainly on the former part of that - people have to use their platforms and stick there or the fountain of Investment Capital runs dry, as this [marvellous Guardian long-read by Richard Seymour](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/23/social-media-addiction-gambling) explains. And the final piece of this puzzle is that nothing sticks like an argument. If we all agree, that's one post each, but if we all want to have the last word, well... 

Every post of Donald Trump's initiated a million "no you're the asshole, no you're the asshole" backs-and-forths, which Twitter could add to their 'stickiness' stats and put in front of investors. This is why he was allowed to go all the way up to encouraging people to attack the Capitol Building before they switched him off. This situation of relying upon arguments and dissent to keep 'engagement' high is not what anyone sane would call healthy, is it?

My research, therefore, concluded that for Social Media to actually deliver upon early promises of 'the wisdom of crowds' and 'bottom-up democratic structures', it needed to be decentralised from the big, industrial players. (Just the concept of making an industry out of people's friendships seems wrong to me). Anyway, it turns out that no less a luminary than Sir Tim Berners-Lee appears to agree with this, as described here, in [another Guardian article by John Harris](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/15/tim-berners-lee-we-need-social-networks-where-bad-things-happen-less).

So Sir Tim has put his weight behind the technological specification for an approach called [Solid](https://solidproject.org/). The idea underpinning this is that people will start storing their own personal data and content in 'Personal Online Data Stores', or Pods. Access to these Pods is controlled using open authentication and authorisation protocols (i.e. the [Solid implementation of Open Id Connect](https://solid.github.io/solid-oidc/)), and the Pod owner gets to grant and revoke access to specific bits of data / content / 'stuff' in their Pod to different 'agents', which would be applications used by specifically-identified individuals or organisations.

Those who have been working in the web area for a long time will know that there's nothing Sir Tim seems to like more than a meaty old specification, so obviously Solid has about a dozen or so of those to cover it's various moving parts, with [this one](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) being the mother. I, on the other hand, like a good picture, so as I'm intrigued by all this, I've done one based on a very quick-and-dirty first look at it all (mainly just reading intro stuff and the basic terminology parts so far).

You may also notice a bit of the terminology of [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD) creeping into my picture (i.e. "Bounded Contexts"). This is something I'm still a bit new to but hopefully the DDD jargon doesn't really affect the info in the diagram too much. What DDD also tells us is that such first pass attempts at understanding are inevitably wrong, so this is going to change as I learn more.

However, at this early stage, one thing I believe could be so significant that I've coloured it blue is the idea that Solid only makes sense in the context of 'other domains'. Eric Evan's [original book about DDD](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/isbn/0321125215/?cm_mmc=ggl-_-UK_ETA_DSA-_-naa-_-naa&gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0Un_0rHUV-jIFMqSB1SUQ4gcyDnN3AoWXnfyR9IrsRbGdQ5hJp32NkaAjEnEALw_wcB) (so significant that he coloured it blue, too) is 20 years old, now, so it discusses the Domain's place in a 'layered architecture' in a way that seems a little dated nowadays. However, a core DDD concept is that 'the Domain' (which is a "representation of business information") should be isolated from "Presentation", "Application" and "Infrastructure" layers. Even if the "layered" way of thinking about this of this seems a bit clunky these days, this need to isolate "a representation of business" from the other moving parts still definitely holds true if you want to be able to make quick and timely changes to your software as new opportunities come to light.

Solid, then, looks to me like it's actually got its fingers more in the Presentation, Application and Infrastructure parts of the pie, so the trick is probably going to be how to adapt it for each Domain you want to apply it to. It's highly likely that the Content, Apps, and People (i.e. Owners and Users) will have significant differences from Domain to Domain, for example, so how might we come up with processes to adapt Solid accordingly? But I'm going to have to dive a lot more deeply into it before I know more.

Off the top of my head, though, I can think of two Domains with potential problems that Solid might help address:
