## Why hello there

This is the personal website of (Dr.) Dave Gerrard (of Philosophy, certainly not Medical).

There's not a _tremendous_ amount here at the moment, the site is basically a scratch-pad for all the various things I'm interested in.

To begin with, the main thing I'm putting on here is the continuing (hopefully long-running) story of [how I'm building this website](Articles/BuildingThisWebsite). (It's a bit "meta" innit?)

The Domain __Trovo.co.uk__ used to point to the website of [my consultancy firm](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06396653), but that's currently dormant while I do a permanent, full time day job ([vague details here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-gerrard-a806411/)). But I ain't going to be blogging about work here...
