# Valuable Agility

![Article Mind Map](./images/Agile_Value.png)

## Strategy and Tactics

### Viability, Feasibility and Desirability

### Deliver Value Not Features 

Or outcomes not outputs.

### No (Heavy) Roadmaps

ICE / GIST / LVTs

### Objectives and Key Results

### Business Modelling

Business Model Canvas. Startup culture caveat.

But the other thing that's undercooked in a lot of Product literature - COSTS!

- Value is *actually* Benefits **-** Costs. Digital systems production really struggles with this!

## Customer Discovery

NIHITO

Problem first, then solution.

The first diamond.

Investigate scenario timelines. "What do you want?" is a dangerous question, and the "Five Whys" are just rude.

### Jobs To Be Done

### Value Propositions

## Products Not Projects

Double-check from EDGE on this one

### The Dreaded MVP

### Hypotheses and Experimentation

Assumption Mapping

### Product / Market Fit

https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html - but link this back to the startup culture caveat.

What is a Pivot, exactly? (Go for the Blank / Osterwalder definition).

## Team Autonomy

### Types of Team

Team Topologies

### Collaboration

"Shared OKRs"

### Decisiveness

### Product Alignment

### Self-Sufficiency

## Unfortunately, senior management need to understand all this...

There's a major change in thinking required for senior execs to let go - to become inspiring leaders instead of managerial plan-deliverers. There are engineering / CTO-Level individuals who have understood small-a-agile for long enough to represent these ideas in the boardroom, but those who represent the rest of the business are lagging behind. Hence the difficulty in adopting OKRs in a lot of companies. "I get paid my large salary to tell people what to do - if I leave it to them to decide, what am I needed for?"

The answer is leadership - but that's fundamentally different from management:

* **Management:** running the uber-strategy and plan, pushing big heavy rocks downhill, and keeping an eye on everyone because I don't trust them to do as good a job as I can.
* **Leadership:** keeping everyone enthusiastic and on-message by inspiring them. Trusting everyone to have the intelligence to deliver the right thing, because I've pointed them at it with clarity.

It takes a lot to step from one to the other. I quite possibly even requires people who are wired-up differently. But small-a-agile, and the ability to truly exploit the frictionless, infinite possibilities of the digital realm, only comes with the latter. As Allen Holub says, though: [this scares the pants off people](https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU?t=665).

### Has the concept of value been polluted by Venture Capital?

If the actual goal is to get to the next round of funding, or to put money in at an early stage with the aim of pulling out at a later round, but before the business has started making decent profits, well, where does this leave the concept of 'value', exactly? Small-a-agile is built upon solving the struggling moment for real customers, not telling tales of potential value - no matter how convincing they may be. When investors' cash is easy to come by, it appears that whatever passes for 'human nature' currently can tend towards the second of these, but the businesses we work for will be more sustainable, and we will better justify our salaries, by building digital products that add real value to real people, on the ground, today.
