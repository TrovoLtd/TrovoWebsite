# Valuable Agility

![Article Mind Map](./images/Agile_Value.png)

## Strategy and Tactics

### Viability, Feasibility and Desirability

### Deliver Value Not Features 

Or outcomes not outputs.

### No (Heavy) Roadmaps

ICE / GIST / LVTs

### Objectives and Key Results

### Business Modelling

Business Model Canvas. Startup culture caveat.

But the other thing that's undercooked in a lot of Product literature - COSTS!

- Value is *actually* Benefits **-** Costs. Digital systems production really struggles with this!

## Customer Discovery

NIHITO

Problem first, then solution.

The first diamond.

Investigate scenario timelines. "What do you want?" is a dangerous question, and the "Five Whys" are just rude.

### Jobs To Be Done

### Value Propositions

## Products Not Projects

Double-check from EDGE on this one

### The Dreaded MVP

### Hypotheses and Experimentation

Assumption Mapping

### Product / Market Fit

https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html - but link this back to the startup culture caveat.

What is a Pivot, exactly? (Go for the Blank / Osterwalder definition).

## Team Autonomy

### Types of Team

Team Topologies

### Collaboration

"Shared OKRs"

### Decisiveness

### Product Alignment

### Self-Sufficiency
