# Valuable Agility

## TLDR of the whole series

This is the third essay of the original series:

1. [The first part](Agile_WhatsThePoint.md) highlights the difference between capital-A-Agile and small-a-agility: a concept ~~stolen~~ [borrowed from Dave Thomas](https://youtu.be/a-BOSpxYJ9M?si=m5g_B7sa9_wK06cp). It also answers the question: "...does anyone remember what the original intent behind promoting agility in software engineering was?" ...with a resounding "NO!".
2. [The second part](Agile_AntiPatterns.md) has a lot of snarky fun pointing out everything that everyone's doing wrong. It bemoans the fact that agility is supposed to be about delivering *value*, above all else. And hardly anyone knows what that's supposed to mean - including quite a few people that society has decreed "incredibly successful".
3. This third and final part is where I finally roll up my sleeves and review some better ways of approaching agility with value at its core. But if I went into real detail we'd be here all month; therefore this essay forms the basis of a curriculum for aligning agility with value delivery in the Digital Realm.

Throughout all three essays I use the phrase "Digital Realm" a lot. The [first article](Agile_WhatsThePoint.md) describes it fully, but a quick definition is: "... the place of frictionless, infinite possibility afforded by working with digital technology". Working here is usually very dangerous and most-often goes horribly wrong, but if you get *good* at working here it starts to offer some serious advantages over working in Real World ways.

## TLDR of this article

The fundamental concept of *value* underpins this essay: a word that's prominent in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, without *actually getting defined anywhere*. Handy, eh? So this whole essay is about defining value. 

It's a weird concept, because at its core it's subjective: something has to be valuable *to someone* (or preferably, lots of someones, or maybe just a few incredibly rich someones)... But (as the previous sentence hinted), unlike most subjective things, it's also inherently *measurable*. There's an SI Unit of value: pounds, shillings and pence. Ok - the *SI Unit* is probably USDs at time of writing, though it could perhaps become the Yuan at any moment.

As befits such a slippery concept, there are more than a few angles to approach from, but as I've been banging on about "agility" for two previous essays, let's approach it from an "Agile Manifesto" direction. There are three of the 12 principles of agility that are hard to get a grip on without thinking about value:

* **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.** This is the most obvious as it actually has the word "valuable" in it. OK, so perhaps two decades of wailing and teeth-gnashing would have been avoided if they'd actually defined "value" in The Manifesto, but like I say, it's a slippery concept.
* **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.** This is perhaps the *hardest* one to get any traction on, as "business people" all tend to have day jobs and can't spend all their time cavorting with software engineers. Indeed, it's fair to say that the whole "Product Owner" concept is a method of dealing with this situation. However, Product people becoming "the voice of the customer" is not just plain risky, it's perhaps *the biggest mistake in the whole of software engineering*, unless it's handled *extremely carefully*. How to do so is a big part of this essay.
* **Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.** As I mentioned in [essay 2](./Agile_AntiPatterns.md), small-a-agility software engineering generates *a lot* of work - automated tests all over the place, endless build pipelines etc - so *you have to make sure the bit that actually gets delivered is valuable*. It's all jolly counter-intuitive if you're not technical.

WRT the second one above: as it's spawned a lot of work for "Product" people, it'll help if we define what a "Product" actually is. If we cheat a bit, it's actually quite easy:

* *A "Product" is a system for delivering value to customers.*

See, nice and simple, as long as we know what *value* is. Read on, Macduff.

Ooh while I'm here, I'd also better include this extra principle, just for luck:

* **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.** OK it doesn't mention value anywhere, but if you want to *deliver* value, it's a good idea to encourage teams to "self-organise" around the value you'd like them to deliver; ergo the Products you would like them to build and maintain. At which point, you have to encourage them to discover that value for themselves.

If you've been brave and read the other two essays, you'll probably be amazed at just how massive a hypocrite I'm being at this point, because *I've focused on four of the 12 principles*, at the expense of the other eight... 

I've done very little else up to now other than bang on about how **you have to do all 12 things**. So please take note, if you only focus on these four and don't do the others, **you will fail**. And not in the good "it's OK because we've learned" way - I mean fail in the "lose all the money and end up out of a job" way.

### The Cast of Characters

There are lots of moving parts to the concept of value, and it can be sliced and diced in a lot of ways. I've not actually *invented* any of this myself, though, of course. So here's a dramatis personae of the key people I've cribbed from.

**Marty Cagan and the Silicon Valley Group**. Marty is pretty much the uber-guru of all this stuff, and has provided a great underlying definition of "value". This forms the basis of the concept of *Product Discovery*, which holds the whole shebang together. So we'll deal with that first. Also fundamental to Product Discovery are **Strategyzer and Alex Osterwalder**, who in turn have a deep and meaningful relationship with **Steve Blank**.
