# We have forgotten the point of Agile

This is the Mind Map of the article I'm writing.

## Does *anyone* remember the point?

### Agile beginnings

(Refer to James Shore here)...

### "It lets you change direction" misses the point

### Univeral Machines and infinite spaces

### Lack of friction

Lots more uncertainty.

Ripe for disruption - very low barriers to entry.

### Manufactured constraints

## Why information and knowledge work is so different

### Vagueness and ambiguity

Brain-wrecking semantic / linguistic debates about abstract concepts.

Digital technology bounces off reality and it'll *never" be a perfect fit. (See Douglas Hofstadter for details. And probably Roger Penrose while you're at it...)

### Your spec with *never* be fixed

... so instead, aim yourselves at problems that you might be able to fix.

### The best you can hope for - glimpses of good answers

Talk to the people with the problem, constantly.

Get their feedback about where your solution to the problem is going

## Has Agile *ever* been "done right"?

### You have to do **ALL** the things

### But they *seem* contradictory?

### In fact they are checks and balances to each other

The Twelve Angry Snakes

### There are two fundamentals

Deliver value *constantly*.

Get better at doing it (also *constantly")

## WTF is "value" exactly?

Brace yourselves as I'm probably going to bang on about my PhD in this bit...

### Bad news - value is subjective

### Good news - it *can* be measured (at least roughly)

Increased profit, reduced costs, reduced risks.
