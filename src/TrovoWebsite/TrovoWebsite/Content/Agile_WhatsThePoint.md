# We have forgotten the point of Agile

## TLDR of the whole series

1. **Have we forgotten the point of "Agile"?** Yes! First and foremost, it was a defensive way of delivering work in a frictionless, unconstrained un-reality of infinite possibilities. Once we remember this, it all makes a lot more sense.
2. **"Agile" Ant-Patterns:** when software engineers, product people and designers all work at loggerheads to each other, it all goes belly up. And even more so when the ways we strategise *aren't* agile.
3. **Valuable agility:** conversely, when software, product and design collaborate beautifully, it's possible to navigate the "digital realm*" not only safely, but in ways that put you way ahead of the competition.

\* Working in software production often feels like the Quantum Realm from Ant-Man but *a lot* weirder.

## Does *anyone* remember the point?

### Agile beginnings

(Refer to James Shore here)...

### "It lets you change direction" misses the point

### Univeral Machines and infinite spaces

### Lack of friction

Lots more uncertainty.

Ripe for disruption - very low barriers to entry.

### Manufactured constraints

## Why information and knowledge work is so different

### Vagueness and ambiguity

Brain-wrecking semantic / linguistic debates about abstract concepts.

Digital technology bounces off reality and it'll *never" be a perfect fit. (See Douglas Hofstadter for details. And probably Roger Penrose while you're at it...)

### Your spec with *never* be fixed

... so instead, aim yourselves at problems that you might be able to fix.

### The best you can hope for - glimpses of good answers

Talk to the people with the problem, constantly.

Get their feedback about where your solution to the problem is going

## Has Agile *ever* been "done right"?

### You have to do **ALL** the things

### But they *seem* contradictory?

### In fact they are checks and balances to each other

The Twelve Angry Snakes

### There are two fundamentals

Deliver value *constantly*.

Get better at doing it (also *constantly")

## WTF is "value" exactly?

Brace yourselves as I'm probably going to bang on about my PhD in this bit...

### Bad news - value is subjective

### Good news - it *can* be measured (at least roughly)

Increased profit, reduced costs, reduced risks.
