# Product / Market Fit

The concept of Product / Market Fit encapsulates the small-a-agile startup's equivalent of the Holy Grail - the point at which your Product has landed successfully upon an eager (and large-enough) cohort of users and customers. The value of using it is obvious to all and sundry. Once you find that fit, you can pull money down from the proverbial magic tree.

I'm not sure the concept can be attributed to one person but [Marc Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) would be one candidate. I particularly like how the article I just linked to has aged since 2007: he cites "search keyword advertising" and "internet auctions" as examples of products with excellent market fit, then contrasts those with "video-conferencing" and "micro-payments" as examples of things that hadn't fulfilled their promise. As mentioned in [article 2](./Agile_AntiPatterns.md), timing is everything, innit? To be a venture capitalist is to be wrong, over and over, and yet somehow end up wealthier than God. Whodathunkit?

This for me highlights something important - product / market fit is usually defined as the Holy Grail *of startups*, but the reality is that its like nailing jelly to a wall, you might get it balanced in place for a while, but this is the Digital Realm we're in; it's fluid and frictionless, and in the unlikely event that you ever achieve a perfect fit, you won't keep it for long without constant change.

The canonical book about finding Product / Market fit is Eric Reis's [The Lean Startup](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-lean-startup/eric-ries/9780670921607), which (clue in the title), firmly roots it all in startup culture. IIRC\* it's also where the benighted term "Minimum Viable Product" comes from (much more about that below). One risk of Product / Market fit in an investment-heavy world is that "proof of fit" can become an end in itself, and can get substituted for *actual value*. This in turn results in a "jam tomorrow" culture, where we get lovely concepts such as "faking it until you (fail to) make it". Eventually, a disproportionate cohort of [the bright young things of the Forbes 30 under 30 end up in prison](https://medium.com/@patelmuqarrab./why-forbes-30-under-30-might-be-the-ultimate-curse-1111cfba747e).

\* Turns out I don't RC at all - it was Frank Robinson, in 2001, apparently. 

But another thing I've personally lived through a couple of times is when companies find great Product / Market fit *by accident*. This isn't as unlikely as it sounds in the Digital Realm - a great technology just finds a market "organically" and delights everyone by affording opportunities they never had before. Companies that did this include, I don't know, Nokia, for example, or Research In Motion. Or Sun Microsystems. Or Apple (nearly).

If your company is making good money out of a ground-breaking technology, but nobody can put their finger on *why*, exactly - then you're in big trouble, even if you're pulling money out of people's wallets for the time being. Inability to articulate why the cool technology is so valuable other than "it's cool" leaves you wide open to customers' "great ideas" about your product, and you won't be able to argue the toss when they insist that you start to break it.

But knowing *why* and *how* your product fits the market means being able to show and tell exactly how much extra value your product is contributing to customers' bottom lines, or the extent to which it's easing their troubles. It keeps everyone focused on constant delivery of value. It helps you notice when that value starts to dip, too (which it will), and suggests ways of fixing that when that happens.

So even if you're *not* a startup, and you have loads of customers, and robust revenue and earnings, and all that other good stuff - if you don't comprehend the fit between your products and their market, in detail - if the only market segment you're sure you're selling to is "people who buy our products" - then you really ought to define your fit retrospectively (and *soon*).
